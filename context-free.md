# Context Free

##  Who is this programming language for?

This is programming language is really for a large audience, but especially for people who want to do digital art. The basics seem easy to understand for everyone, but using its functions and recursions may require more experienced users.

## What is easy to do in this language? Why is it easy?

Creating shapes seems easy as you can easily define that shape without a lot of code and see it on the screen next to it.

## What is hard to do in this language? Why is it hard?

I believe the general syntax is very hard to understand for someone like me. I tried looking at the sample code and other examples but am still clueless. The syntax can be hard for beginners like me, even though it seems easy.

## How did you learn how to program in this language?

I tried reading its GitHub and by looking at other examples, but did not really learn anything, I am very clueless and lost and would love some help.

## What is the underlying _computational model_ for this programming language? 
_We don't yet have a great definition of the term "computational model". 
For now, try to come up with the clearest, most concise explanation of what 
happens when a ContextFree program runs._

When a program runs, it parses the code to create a digital image. All the shapes are defined in different ways, so it goes through each of them to create the desired image.

## What do you think is interesting about the ContextFree  program you wrote?

Unfortunately, I had to use some of the sample code and used its vinel because I am very clueless about this. I tried days trying to understand how it works, but my head just could not wrap around the syntax of ContextFree. So, there is not a lot of interesting things in my image.
